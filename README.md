Simple MC License Bypass Tool

A lightweight tool for players without a Minecraft license — created because the old method got patched.

🧩 How to Use

Download the DLL for your Minecraft version from the Releases page.

Rename the file to vcruntime140_1.dll.

Place it in your Minecraft installation folder (the same directory as Minecraft.Windows.exe).

Launch the game — it should now recognize you as licensed.

That’s it! No extra setup required.
